# Simulator-Offshore-Wind-Turbine
This is a MATLAB code to simulate an offshore wind turbine that I developed during my master thesis. 

It consists of the following 2 folders

  - Linear folder: All, the loads, soil springs and aerodynamic forces have been linearised. Use Main_Script_lin.m to run.
  - Non_Linear folder: All, the loads, soil springs and aerodynamic forces have non-linear characteristics. 
  Soil springs have been modelled using P-Y curves and aero / hydrodynamic forces have non- linear terms in them.
  Use Main_Script_lin.m to run.
  - A number of parameters can be changed and an offshore wind turbine can be simulated. Natural frequencies can also be obtained.
